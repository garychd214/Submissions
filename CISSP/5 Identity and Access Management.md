# Identity and Access Management
- Authentication
- Investigating Federated Identity
- Surveying Access Control Models

## Authentication
Authentication is the verification of identity
- Zero-knowledge proof is authentication without openly revealing a password
    - Open standard CHAP, MS-CHAP
- "Mutual" authentication is when both the subject and object(Resource) identify themselves to each other
    - Kerberos, SESAME

### CHAP
Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)
- zero-knowledge
- Relies on randomly generated string of characters called "challenge text" and a hashing algorithm.
#### Process

<br>

### Kerberos
Kerberos is an SSO system embedded in most network operating systems and directory services that provices mutual authentication and uses symmetric key cryptography and tickets to convey authentication details to the parties securely
- User
- Server
    - Key Distribution Center (KDC)
        - Trusted or trusting principals: Realm or Domain
    - Authentication Server (AS)
    - Ticket Granting Service (TGS)
- Resource
<br> Trusted Principal

#### Security 
- The Kerberos Server should be hardened single purpose server 
- it's a single point of failure and should be implemented in high availability mode

#### Process

## SESAME
Secure European Systems for Aplications in a Multi-Vendor Environment (SESAME) is a single sign-on authentication system similar to Kerberos
- Primarily used within applications; not Operating systems
- Depends on the same initial user authentication
- SESAME uses both symmetric AND asymmetric key-based technologies to authenticate subjects
- SESAME uses privileged attribute Certificates (PAC) instead of Tickets generated by a privileged attribute server (PAS)

## Federated Identity Management
Federated Identity Management (FIM) is an arrangement made among multiple enterprises that allows users to use the same identification data to obtain access to disparate resources
- SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
<img src = "Pics/CISSP SAML.jpg">
    - Process
    <img src = "Pics/CISSP SAML Process.jpg">
    - SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol)
        - SAML transport options include HTTP Redirect  (GET), HTTP Post, or a SOAP binding
        - SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchanging messages in a decentralized distributed environment.
- OAuth 2.0
    - OAuth is "<b><u>Authorization</b></u>" framework not the Authentication
    <img src = "Pics/CISSP OAuth.jpg">
    - Example: Logging into app with Google Account
    - Process
    <img src = "Pics/CISSP OAuth Process.jpg">

- OpenID
- OpenID Connect
    - OpenID Connect is a "New" identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0 which facilitates "<b><u>Authentication</b></u>"
    - OpenID Connect allows users to be authenticated by co-operating sites using a third-party service
    - Users can log in to multiple unrelated websites without having to have a separate identity and password for each
    - The id-token includes information about th euser
    - Repleacement for SAML
    - Can be used by both mobile and static applications

- Web Service Specification
- Microsoft Azure Cloud Services
- Windows Identity Foundtaion

## Access Control Model
An access control model is a framework that dictates how subjects access objects or how objects access objects
- Access control models are built-in to operating systems and som applications

### Options
- Subject-based Access
    - Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
        - Access is based on the relationship between subjects clearance and need to know and what objects classification 
        - Enforce with Security labels
    - Discretionary Acess Control (DAC)
        - Data owners decide subject access
        - Enforce with Access Controls Lists, Capabilities Tables
    - Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
        - Access is based on the subject's assigned roles
        - Enforce with Access Controls Lists, Capabilities Table, Security policy
- Situational Based Access
    - Rule-based Access Control
        - Access based on situational if-then statements
        - Enforce with Rules
    - Content-based Access Control
        - Filter based on the data being acted upon
        - Enforce with Keywords, Categories
    - Context-based Access Control
        - Access based on a collection or sequence of actions
        - Enforce with Rules, Security policy
    - Constrained interfaces
        - Access Restriced by functionality
        - Enforce with Degisn, Configuration
