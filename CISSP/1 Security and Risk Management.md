- Exposure factor (EF) expressed as a %
- Single loss expectancy (SLE) expressed in $
- Annualized rate of Occurrence (ARO) expressed as a # - (How frequent this will happen every year)
- Annualized loss exprectancy (ALE) expressed in $
- Cost/Benefit Analysis(CBA) expressed in $

- SLE = AV * EF
- ALE = SLE * ARO
- CB = (ALE1 - ALE2) - Annualized cost of Mitigation

### Business Impact Analysis - for Business Contiunity plan
- Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
    - Work Recovery Time (WRT): after the (automatic) recovery, manual work that needed for FMC
